# Udacity: Rock-Paper-Scissors Project
# Project Summary
This is a project from the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. In this project, you  get to play the game of Rock Paper Scissors.

The game has two players. In a single round of the game, each player secretly chooses one of three moves, or "throws" — rock, paper, or scissors. Then, players reveal their moves at the same time. If both players picked the same move, there is no winner. Otherwise, rock beats scissors; paper beats rock; and scissors beat paper. 

The lines of codes are written in python.
